# AI Financial Assistant Demo - Development Summary

## Project Overview
Built a complete demo application showing how RL can be used to improve small language models for financial data queries. The system demonstrates that while small local models are initially inaccurate and good remote models are too slow, RL fine-tuning on small models can bridge the gap.

## What Was Built

### 1. Project Structure
- Set up Python virtual environment with all necessary dependencies
- Created modular structure with backend/, frontend/, data/, and scripts/ directories
- Configured .gitignore for Python and Node.js

### 2. Database Layer (backend/database.py)
- SQLite database with three tables: tickers, metrics, financial_data
- Async database operations using aiosqlite
- Proper indexing for performance
- Support for storing financial data with proper units (USD, percentages, ratios)

### 3. Data Loading (data/tiingo_loader.py)
- Tiingo API integration for real financial data
- Fallback to sample data when API key not available
- Automatic unit conversion (millions to billions for large USD values)
- Populated database with 10 major tech/finance companies

### 4. Agent System (backend/agent.py)
- Financial agent with tool calling capabilities:
  - get_metrics(): Returns available financial metrics
  - get_tickers(): Returns available stock tickers
  - get_value(metric, ticker, period): Retrieves specific financial values
  - calculate(num1, num2, operation, duration): Performs calculations including CAGR
  - return_answer(answer): Returns the final completion
- Smart completion detection based on financial keywords
- Tool call parsing from LLM responses
- Support for both OpenAI and Ollama models

### 5. FastAPI Backend (backend/main.py)
- CORS-enabled API server
- Endpoints:
  - POST /api/completion: Get inline completions with tool calls
  - POST /api/batch-evaluation: Evaluate models on test sets
  - POST /api/upload-evaluation-csv: Upload test cases
  - GET /api/financial-data: View financial data
  - GET /api/tickers: List available tickers
  - GET /api/metrics: List available metrics
- Async request handling for performance

### 6. React Frontend
- **TextEditor Component**: 
  - Copilot-style grey text suggestions
  - Tab to accept functionality
  - Debounced API calls (500ms delay)
  - Loading states
  
- **ActivityLog Component**:
  - Real-time display of tool calls
  - Shows tool name, arguments, and results
  - Timestamps for each call
  
- **MetricsTable Component**:
  - Tracks latency for each request
  - Shows which model was used
  - Sorted by most recent
  
- **Evaluation Component**:
  - CSV file upload
  - Batch evaluation across multiple models
  - Correctness indicators (/)
  - Overall accuracy scores
  
- **FundamentalsViewer Component**:
  - Dropdown ticker selection
  - Table view of all financial metrics
  - Data organized by time period

### 7. Synthetic Data Generation (scripts/generate_synthetic_data.py)
- Generates test cases with and without financial data requirements
- Creates evaluation and training datasets
- Realistic financial query templates
- Ground truth completions based on actual database values

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Async Everything**: Used async/await throughout for better performance
2. **Tool Calling Pattern**: Agent uses explicit tool syntax that can be parsed from LLM output
3. **Unit Handling**: Automatic conversion of large USD values to billions for readability
4. **Debouncing**: 500ms delay before triggering completions to avoid excessive API calls
5. **Modular Components**: Each UI component is self-contained and reusable

## Current Limitations

1. **Local Model Integration**: Ollama integration is coded but requires Ollama to be running locally with the specified model
2. **Limited Financial Data**: Only sample data for 3 companies (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL) with full metrics
3. **Simple Evaluation**: Basic string matching for correctness, could use more sophisticated metrics
4. **No Real-time Data**: Static historical data only, no live market feeds

## How to Run

1. Backend: `source venv/bin/activate && python backend/main.py`
2. Frontend: `cd frontend && npm start`
3. Access at http://localhost:3000

## Next Steps for RL Implementation

1. Create training pipeline that:
   - Collects successful completions as positive examples
   - Uses failed completions as negative examples
   - Implements PPO or DPO for fine-tuning
   
2. Model serving infrastructure:
   - Endpoint to load fine-tuned model weights
   - A/B testing between base and fine-tuned models
   - Performance tracking

3. Enhanced evaluation:
   - Semantic similarity metrics
   - Tool call efficiency scoring
   - Latency vs accuracy tradeoffs
